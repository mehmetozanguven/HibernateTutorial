# Hibernate Mapping Tutorial with Hibernate 5

- This project includes the tutorials for hibernate mapping such as OneToOne, OneToMany, ManyToMany
- I used Postgresql as a database and Fedora 30 as an operating system



## OneToOne Mapping

- In this scheme, there is a Instructor object and each Instructor has only one associated object called InstructorDetail
- Thus, there is a OneToOne relationship between Instructor and InstructorDetails

> Before running the project, please create the tables first.

- Open the terminal and write `sudo -u postgres psql` 
- Then choose your database via `\c yourDatabaseName` 
- Then write sql codes sequentially

**INSTRUCTOR DETAIL table** sql code:

```sql
CREATE TABLE INSTRUCTOR_DETAIL(
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    youtube_channel TEXT,
    hobby TEXT
);
```



**INSTRUCTOR table** sql code:

```sql
CREATE TABLE INSTRUCTOR(
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name TEXT,
    last_name TEXT,
    email TEXT,
    instructor_detail_id SERIAL,
    FOREIGN KEY (instructor_detail_id) REFERENCES INSTRUCTOR_DETAIL(id)
);
```

## OneToOne Bidirectional Mapping
- In the first example (OneToOne Mapping), I couldn't reach the `instructor` from the `instructor_detail` table. Now I will update only the Java codes (without touching the sql codes) which allow me to access instructor from instructor_detail
- To enable this propert, I need to use `mappedBy` property in the `@OneToOne` annotation.
- Shortly `@OneToOne(mappedBy="instructorDetail")`
- In detail, mappedBy means that:
	- The @JoinColumn annotation helps us specify the column weâ€™ll use for joining an entity association or element collection. On the other hand, the mappedBy attribute is used to define the referencing side (non-owning side) of the relationship.
	- The value of mappedBy is the name of the association-mapping attribute on the owning side
	- When I apply this property in my project, I update the `InstructerDetail` class:

```java
public class SimpleInstructorDetail{
....
//add new property for bidirectional
	@OneToOne(mappedBy = "instructorDetail", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
	private SimpleInstructor simpleInstructor;
	
	...
	
	public SimpleInstructor getSimpleInstructor() {
		return simpleInstructor;
	}


	public void setSimpleInstructor(SimpleInstructor simpleInstructor) {
		this.simpleInstructor = simpleInstructor;
	}
}
```
