# Hibernate Mapping Tutorial with Hibernate 5

- This project includes the tutorials for hibernate mapping such as OneToOne, OneToMany, ManyToMany
- I used Postgresql as a database and Fedora 30 as an operating system


## OneToOne Mapping

- In this scheme, there is a Instructor object and each Instructor has only one associated object called InstructorDetail
- Thus, there is a OneToOne relationship between Instructor and InstructorDetails

> Before running the project, please create the tables first.

- Open the terminal and write `sudo -u postgres psql` 
- Then choose your database via `\c yourDatabaseName` 
- Then write sql codes sequentially

**INSTRUCTOR DETAIL table** sql code:

```sql
CREATE TABLE INSTRUCTOR_DETAIL(
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    youtube_channel TEXT,
    hobby TEXT
);
```



**INSTRUCTOR table** sql code:

```sql
CREATE TABLE INSTRUCTOR(
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name TEXT,
    last_name TEXT,
    email TEXT,
    instructor_detail_id integer,
    FOREIGN KEY (instructor_detail_id) REFERENCES INSTRUCTOR_DETAIL(id)
);
```

## OneToOne Bidirectional Mapping
- In the first example (OneToOne Mapping), I couldn't reach the `instructor` from the `instructor_detail` table. Now I will update only the Java codes (without touching the sql codes) which allow me to access instructor from instructor_detail
- To enable this propert, I need to use `mappedBy` property in the `@OneToOne` annotation.
- Shortly `@OneToOne(mappedBy="instructorDetail")`
- In detail, mappedBy means that:
	- The @JoinColumn annotation helps us specify the column weâ€™ll use for joining an entity association or element collection. On the other hand, the mappedBy attribute is used to define the referencing side (non-owning side) of the relationship.
	- The value of mappedBy is the name of the association-mapping attribute on the owning side
	- When I apply this property in my project, I update the `InstructerDetail` class:

```java
public class SimpleInstructorDetail{
....
//add new property for bidirectional
	@OneToOne(mappedBy = "instructorDetail", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
	private SimpleInstructor simpleInstructor;
	
	...
	
	public SimpleInstructor getSimpleInstructor() {
		return simpleInstructor;
	}


	public void setSimpleInstructor(SimpleInstructor simpleInstructor) {
		this.simpleInstructor = simpleInstructor;
	}
}
```

## OneToMany Mapping Bidirectional
- Instructor can have many course

> For simplicity, course can only be given one instructor

 - If I delete any instructor, I shouldn't delete the course !!
 - If I delete any course, I shouldn't delete the instructor of that course !!

> Before running the project, please add the new table called COURSE

```sql
CREATE TABLE COURSE(
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT UNIQUE,
    instructor_id integer,
    FOREIGN KEY (instructor_id) REFERENCES INSTRUCTOR(id)
);
```

> UNIQUE constraint is used to prevent duplicate course titles

## EAGER vs LAZY LOADING
- **Eager** loading will load all dependent entities
- For example, Instructor will have many courses. With eager loading we will load all the courses of the specific instructor
- **Lazy** loading will load only on request. It will only load the main entity first.
- For example, there are many students in the course, therefore we shouldn't load all the student when we load only one course.
- We can define eager or lazy load when we define the mapping relationship.
- Default type:
	- `@OneToOne : FetchType.EAGER`
	- `@OneToMany: FetchType.LAZY`
	- `@ManyToOne: FetchType.EAGER`
	- `@ManyToMany: FetchType.LAZY` 

```java
@Entity
@Table(name="instructor")
public class Instructor{
	...
	@OneToMany(fetch=FetchType.LAZY, mappedBy="instructor)
	private List<Course> courses;

}
```

- Because we are using lazy loading, we require an open Hibernate session
- What happens if the Hibernate session is closed?
	- If we trying to retrieve data, when session is closed, Hibernate will throw an exception
- **To retrieve data, we need an open Hibernate session**
- We have 2 options for retrieving lazy data:</br>
	1. `session.get` and call appropriate getter methods </br>
	2 Hibernate query with HQL
	
### 1. Call appropriate getter method

```java
public class MainApp{
	public static void main ... {
		Session session = factory.getCurrentSession();
		//...
		Instructor tempInstructor = session.get(Instructor.class, instructorId);
		
		System.out.println("Instructor" + tempInstructor);
		// this will hit the database on lazy loading
		System.out.println("Couses of that instructor " + tempInstructor.getCourses);
		// close the session
		session.close();
		// because of the data in the memory, this will not hit the database, and print the courses correctly
		System.out.println("From memory " + tempInstructor.getCourses());
	}
}
```

### 2. Hibernate Query with HQL

```java
public class MainApp{
	public static void main ... {
		Session session = factory.getCurrentSession();
		//...
		Long instructorId = 1;
		Query<Instructor> query = session.createQuery("select i from Instructor i ",
											+"JOIN FETCH i.courses "
											+"where i.id =:instructorId", 
												Instructor.class);
		query.setParameter("instructorId", instructorId);
		
		// execute query and get instructor
		// this will load all courses at once, because of the query
		Instructor tempInstructor = query.getSingleResult();
		System.out.println("Instructor" + tempInstructor);
	
		session.getTransaction().commit();
		session.close();
		
		System.out.println("This courses come from memory:" + tempInstructor.getCourses());
	}
}
```

## OneToMany Uni-Directional
- A courses can have many reviews
- If I delete a course, I should also delete the reviews
- Reviews without a course, have no meaning

> Before running the project add the REVIEW table to the database

```sql
CREATE TABLE REVIEW(
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    comment TEXT,
    course_id integer,
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES COURSE(id)
);
```


## ManyToMany Relation
- Courses can have many students
- Students can have many courses

First we need to track which student is in which course course and vice-versa

To do that, we will add 2 tables (one for Student and one for CourseStudent). The latter one will hold the foreign keys for each table called `Join Table`

- Student table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE STUDENT(
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	first_name TEXT,
	last_name TEXT,
	email TEXT
);
```

- CourseStudent table

```sql
CREATE TABLE COURSE_STUDENT(
	course_id integer,
	student_id integer,
	PRIMARY KEY(course_id, student_id),
	FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES COURSE(id),
	FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES STUDENT(id)
);
```
	
	

For example:

- Course table includes:

10, Java, 2 (CouseId, Title, InstructorId)</br>
20, Python, 2 (CouseId, Title, InstructorId)

- and Student table includes

100, John, Doe, test@test.com (StudentId, FirstName, LastName, Email)</br>
200, Susan, Dash, test1@test.com (StudentId, FirstName, LastName, Email)

- then, CourseStudent table will include something like that :

10, 100 (CourseId, StudentId)</br>
10, 200 (CourseId, StudentId)</br>
20, 200 (CourseId, StudentId)


- Create the Student java class which includes code segment like:

```java
public class Student{
	//...
	@ManyToMany(
			fetch = FetchType.LAZY,
			cascade = {CascadeType.DETACH, CascadeType.MERGE,
					CascadeType.PERSIST, CascadeType.REFRESH}
			)
	@JoinTable(
			name = "COURSE_STUDENT",
			joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "student_id"),
			inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "course_id")
			)
	private List<Course> courses;
}
```

- Now update the Course class like this:

```java
public class Course{
	...
	@ManyToMany
	@JoinTable(
		name = "COURSE_STUDENT"
		joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "course_id"), 
		inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "student_id")
	)
	private List<Students> students;
}
```
